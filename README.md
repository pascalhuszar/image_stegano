# Abstract
Encrypting secret messages prevents adversaries from obtaining
sensitive information. However, an encrypted message attracts
attention, which is not desired when secrets are exchanged. To conceal
the secret message itself, image steganography is a technique that attempts
to hide the message in images. There are several approaches that
use different strategies. The most promising is SteganoGAN by Zhang
et al. Their model is capable of hiding up to 4.4 bits per pixel of
arbitrary data inside images while it evades detection by steganalysis
tools. On the basis of SteganoGAN, the motives and the concepts of
steganographic systems are expressed in this paper.
